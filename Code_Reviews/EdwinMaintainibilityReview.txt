Sprint #4
PlayerInventory.cs
Maggie Feng
Number of Minutes: 10
The code is maintainable as we approach our last sprint.
To add possible new items, you would only have to declare
them in the enum and then add the item to the dictionary.
It also includes a feature to remove the item from the 
inventory once Link uses it and adds an item when link 
picks one up.
