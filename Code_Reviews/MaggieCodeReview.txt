Comments: 
- Uses descriptive method and variable names which makes it more readable
- Very long class, which makes the class a little less readable since it's very long
- Overall, the readability of the class is good. Easy to understand what the class
is supposed to do (create and play sounds) with the descriptive variable names

Comments on code quality: 
- Uses a lot of dependicies, so has high coupling. 
- Uses some magic numbers which makes it less maintainable in case of future changes
- Very long class file. Could separate file into multiple parts 
- Overall, this class could be refactored so it is more maintainable and uses less hardcoded values
Hypothetical change:  I
- If we changed the screen size of the game, this class would not easily support the change because it uses
a lot of magic numbers to hardcode position of sprites.We would have to modify all the numbers
in the file to support the screen size change.
