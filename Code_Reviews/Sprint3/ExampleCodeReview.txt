Comments on Code Quality (or Code maintainability, write one review for each):
This class is very readable because the variable names are good and the code is divided into smaller methods etc. etc. etc. (except write like a paragraph or two).
[Include hypothetical change to the game related to the file, how the file's current implementation could/couldn't easily support that change]
