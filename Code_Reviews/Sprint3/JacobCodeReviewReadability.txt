The CollisionIterator.cs file has very good code readability.  It uses dynamic and static objects which passes through to a handler and clearly defines them. 
Based off of what type of collision the handler can then choose whichever collision file it needs to execute that certain collision. This is good because it breaks
it into smaller methods and allows for easier readability.
