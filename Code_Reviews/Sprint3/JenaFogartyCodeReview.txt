Comments on Code Maintainability:

High cohesion: as the class only creates the sprite & the method do a singular task.
Loose coupling: IEnemySprite 
Hypothetical change: A significantly larger enemy that would require a larger sprite for spawn. This could be refactored through passing a int scale parameter. 

Comments on Code Readability:
Uses effective naming convention for both class & functions
High cohesion (see above): Makes class readable
