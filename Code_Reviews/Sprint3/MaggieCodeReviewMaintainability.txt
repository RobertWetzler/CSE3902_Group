Maintainability comments:
- Loose coupling which is good. Only needs ICollidable and IPlayer.
- Uses interfaces, which is good. Allows for more abstraction
- Easy to refactor because of loose coupling and uses interfaces
- High cohesion. Class does 1 thing which is handle block vs. player collisions
- We might need to add more collision handling with the player later. Maybe with different types of blocks like movable vs unmovable. This class can support this change easily because it is very generalized. This class can handle collisions with any types of blocks.
