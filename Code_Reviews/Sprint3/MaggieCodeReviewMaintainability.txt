Maintainability comments:
- Loose coupling which is good. Only needs ICollidable and IPlayer.
- Uses interfaces, which is good. Allows for more abstraction
- Easy to refactor because of loose coupling and uses interfaces
- High cohesion. Class does 1 thing which is handle block vs. player collisions
