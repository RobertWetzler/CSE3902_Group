Maintainability comments:
- High Cohesion within each method. Each method only interacts with it's specific type
- The methods all reuse a fair amount of code, perhaps a helper method could be used.
- The file is more than 150 lines, perhaps each method could be it's own class and share a common interface.
- Hypothetically, consider that another item needed to be parsed from the XML. It wouldn't be difficult to create another method for this, 
but also it would make the file a decent amount longer (could possibly be addressed by above comment).
