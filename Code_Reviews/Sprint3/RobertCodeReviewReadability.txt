Readability comments:
- GetCollisionSide is somewhat hard to read. Although there are no unnecessary comments in the method, I think this method is an exception and could benefit
from comments explaining what variables like "xGap" and "xOverlap" mean. Alternatively, perhaps better variable names could be used in this method.
- Consider that this method needed to be modified such that "subject" has a triangle bounding box instead of a rectangle. Given the way the method was written, it would be difficult to redo. The entire method would likely need to be re-written from it's original.
