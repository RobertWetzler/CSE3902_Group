Comments on Code Quality:
- This class is readable with descriptive variable names such as blockSpriteSheet and destRectangle. 
- The Rectangle1 is a type of block assembling and its definition is relatively vague, but the class name here is acceptable. 
- The sprite class has proper line length, consistent identation and naming scheme to improve readability. 
- It also does not have unecessary comment.
