Time Taken: 27
 
Code Maintainability:
- Abstraction due to usage of interfaces. 
- Cohesion is good, SmallHUD only does what is present in the small HUB not over reaching in to Big Hub. 
- Makes usage of utiltity class which increases cohesion. 
- Magic numbers are used for positioning which isn't ideal.
- The class has good maintainability outside of the magic numbers. 
- Because there are so many magic numbers for the positioning, any adjustments to the size of the game would result in a refactoring of the SmallHUD.


Code Quality(Readability): 
- No random comments, which makes it easier to read. 
- Less than 150 lines of code. 
- Method does one thing and that is create the SmallHub making it easier to read. 
- 3 conditional statements, but doesn't really make the code harder to read. 
- The class has good readability.
