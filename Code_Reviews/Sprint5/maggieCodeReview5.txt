Comments on code quality: 
- Abstract class so you can apply it to any class that derives it
- Can extend the class so other class can inherit the properties of the class
- Overall very reusable as a lot of other classes can extend from this class
- If you wanted more objects that can light up, this class can easily support that change
- You can easily extend this class and overwrite the methods in this class.
